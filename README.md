# Vending-Machine-Design
This project implements a complete Vending Machine Controller in Verilog HDL, built with a modular architecture, support for multiple clock domains, and APB-based configuration. It operates in both configuration and operational modes, enabling real-time item selection, purchase, and dispensing based on valid currency inputs.
